#### This is just a proof of concept project for typescript following net ninja's tutorials. [(link to his playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI)

In this project I will be remaking a basic financial logger using typescript

After completing this playlist. I will make a mini-blog site with markdown parser and editor. (will not add authentication for simplicity)
